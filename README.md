# DataScience-Bootcamp-Final_Project
This project involves reading two different datasets that contains breast cancer diagnosis and MRI images. The user can input different dimensions of diagnosis and will output whether it results to Malignant or Benign. The other feature is to upload an MRI picture and will result whether it results to Malignant or Benign (using a Xception model).
